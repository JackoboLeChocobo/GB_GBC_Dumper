Writing a value to 0x2000-0x3FFF will set the current selected ROM bank. This bank is located at 0x4000-0x7FFF. Also, when bank 0 is selected, it is remapped to be bank 1. Bank 1 is the default selection.

When selecting the ROM bank, if you specify a bank number >= 0x40, the number will roll back to 0x00


Writing a value to 0x4000-0x5FFF will set the current RAM bank, accessable at 0xA000-0xBFFF. if a value >= 0x04 is given, the value will cycle back to 0x00. Bank 0 is the default selection.

Memory Map:
0x0000-0x3FFF = ROM Bank 0, unswitchable
  0x0000-0x1FFF (Write) = RAM Bank Write Enable (0x0A = Enable, 0x00 = Disable)
  0x2000-0x3FFF (Write) = ROM Bank Select (0x00-0x3F)
0x4000-0x7FFF = ROM Bank X, switchable
  0x4000-0x5FFF (Write) = RAM Bank Select (0x00-0x03)
  0x6000-0x7FFF (Write) = Counter Latch (0x00=unlatch, 0x01=latch)
0x8000-0x9FFF = Memory hole (returns 0x00)
0xA000-0xBFFF = Cartridge RAM, switchable
0xC000-0xFFFF = Memory hole (returns 0x00)
